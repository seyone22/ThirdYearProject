\subsection{Review on the Existing System}
We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the existing used books exchange websites. Those websites are aiming to provide a detailed overview of their features, performance, and user experience. This review serves as a foundation for our proposal to enhance and optimize the system to meet the evolving needs of our users. The mostly existing systems are focused on E-commerce or Cataloging, with limited emphasis on a comprehensive bookshop management system.

Common observations of some existing systems are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User interfaces vary in terms of simplicity and complexity.
    \item Integration with book databases and APIs is common for data retrieval and management.
\end{itemize}

Here's an overview of some of the globally existing websites:

\subsubsection{Amazon}
Amazon is a popular online Web-App that offers both new and used books for sale through third-party sellers. Users can find a wide selection of used books in various conditions. It offers a vast collection of books and a user-friendly interface. This system has several subcategories that the books are classified by department, format, author, promotions, prizes, languages, etc. The user rating and book description part of amazon.com are one of the best features, as it allows users to make an informed decision before purchasing a book. 
However, the disadvantages of this website are,
1. E-commerce focus
2. Limited transparency
3.lack of personalization
4. High transaction cost

\subsubsection{Goodreads}
Goodreads primarily serves as a social platform for readers, also some users may offer books for trade or giveaway in discussion forums. This includes details about authors, publication information, and user-generated content. The site allows users to set and track reading goals for the year, which is a great feature for people who like to challenge themselves to read more. It allows users to create virtual bookshelves, rate books, and connect with other readers. However, disadvantages of this are,
1. Limited transaction capabilities
2. Incomplete listings
3. Complex selling process

\subsubsection{AbeBooks}
AbeBooks is a well-established online marketplace for books, including new, used, rare, and out-of-print versions of books. Many independent sellers and bookstores list their inventory on AbeBooks, which means you can find books that may not be available on mainstream platforms. This website's interface is user-friendly, and sellers on AbeBooks typically provide detailed descriptions of the book's condition, edition, etc., as well as international shipping options. This helps buyers make informed decisions. The website consists of rare or antique books, often including first editions and signed copies. Disadvantages of using this are,
1. Limited free listings
2. Commercial nature

Here's an overview of some of the locally existing websites:

\subsubsection{Bookberry.lk}
Bookberry is an online website that offers to sell used books online. Even though not overly famous across Sri Lanka gives the facility to bank deposit or cash on delivery option for buyers. Disadvantages are that it doesn't contain a large collection of books and user interfaces are not friendly. 

\subsubsection{UsedBooks.lk}
UsedBooks.lk is an online marketplace for books where you can find used and rare books used by independent traders around Sri Lanka for sale.
Website contains detailed descriptions on the book's condition and photos uploaded by the seller. They also have various categories of books but the drawback is that since the books aren't categorized correctly the buyer finds trouble in sorting through the catelog looking for the book he wants. Registration process is fairly easy which creates oppotunities for fake sellers. Another notable disadvantage is that even though books have been used the prices are overly high which may discourage lot of buyers. 

\subsubsection{bookswap.lk}
BookSwap.lk is free online platform for exchange used books or sell books free online. You can buy second hand books, text books or used books by institutions. Even though they have put up an extensive collection of books the website is still completed as they haven't specified a payment method. Platform encourages to meet the buyer personally rather than online transactions which might not be appealing for some customers.
